GBM Gene Expression Noise Analysis Report
========================================

1. Coefficient of Variation (CV) Calculation:
   - For each gene, mean and variance of expression across all cells were calculated.
   - CV = sqrt(variance) / mean.

2. High- and Low-Noise Gene Classification:
   - Genes were ranked by CV.
   - Top 10%: 'high-noise genes'.
   - Bottom 10%: 'low-noise genes'.

3. Statistical Test:
   - Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare CV between GBM and non-GBM genes.
   - p-value: 0

4. Interpretation:
   - There is a statistically significant difference in expression noise between GBM and non-GBM genes.
