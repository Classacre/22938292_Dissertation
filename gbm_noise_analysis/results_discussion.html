<h1>Results and Discussion</h1>

<div class="section">
<h2>1. Identification of High- and Low-Noise Genes</h2>
<p>Gene expression noise was quantified as the coefficient of variation (CV) for each gene across all single cells. Genes were ranked by CV, with the top 10% classified as high-noise and the bottom 10% as low-noise. This classification is visualized in the following figures:</p>

<h2>2. Identification and Characterization of Responsive Genes</h2>
<p>Responsive genes were defined as those highly expressed in one cell type but low in others. The top 10% by responsiveness score were classified as highly responsive. Visualizations include:</p>

<h2>4. Statistical Results and Overlap Analysis</h2>
<p>All group comparisons were summarized in tables. Key p-values:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Bewick gbM vs non-gbM: <b>p = 1.08 × 10⁻²¹⁴</b></li>
  <li>Bewick TE-like vs other: <b>p = 2.03 × 10⁻⁷³</b></li>
  <li>H2A.Z-Depleted vs H2A.Z-Enriched: <b>p = 0</b></li>
  <li>Responsive vs Non-Responsive (CV): <b>p = 1.08 × 10⁻¹²</b></li>
  <li>Fisher's exact (Cahn): <b>p = 1.56 × 10⁻¹⁷</b></li>
  <li>Fisher's exact (Bewick): <b>p = 3.67 × 10⁻¹³</b></li>
  <li>Fisher's exact (H2A.Z): <b>p = 3.09 × 10⁻⁷</b></li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h2>5. Discussion and Interpretation</h2>
<p><b>Hypothesis Evaluation:</b> The results strongly support the hypothesis that gbM and H2A.Z depletion are associated with reduced gene expression noise. All statistical comparisons yielded extremely low p-values, indicating robust differences between groups. The visualizations (see Figures 1–17) reinforce these findings, with clear separation of noise distributions by methylation and H2A.Z status.</p>
<p>Responsive genes, which are cell-type-specific, are more likely to be noisy and less likely to be gbM or H2A.Z-depleted. This suggests that epigenetic stability is a hallmark of housekeeping genes, while regulatory genes are more dynamic.</p>
<p><bB>Broader Implications:</bB> The integration of methylation and chromatin features provides a nuanced view of gene regulation in plant single cells. The results highlight the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in stabilizing gene expression and shaping cell identity.</p>
<p><b>Limitations and Future Directions:</b> The analysis is limited to a single, unpublished Seurat object. Broader validation is needed. Responsive gene classification could be refined with more sophisticated models. Future work should explore the mechanistic basis of these associations.</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>This study provides a comprehensive, integrative analysis of gene expression noise, methylation, and chromatin features in Arabidopsis root single cells. The results confirm that gbM and H2A.Z depletion are associated with stable, low-noise gene expression, while cell-type-specific and highly variable genes are depleted for these features. These findings advance our understanding of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression variability in plants.</p>
