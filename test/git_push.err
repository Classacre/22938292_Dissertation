Hook already exists: pre-push

	#!/bin/sh
	command -v git-lfs >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "\nThis repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path. If you no longer wish to use Git LFS, remove this hook by deleting the 'pre-push' file in the hooks directory (set by 'core.hookspath'; usually '.git/hooks').\n"; exit 2; }
	git lfs pre-push "$@"

To resolve this, either:
  1: run `git lfs update --manual` for instructions on how to merge hooks.
  2: run `git lfs update --force` to overwrite your hook.
